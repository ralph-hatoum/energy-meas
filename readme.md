# Energy consumption measurement on Grid5000
This repository is dedicated to making energy consumption measurements on Grid5000. 
## Goal
My main goal is to measure the energy overhead incurred by sending segments over TCP, opposed to simply having the machine on but idle. I also used this project as a first experience running jobs on Grid5000.
